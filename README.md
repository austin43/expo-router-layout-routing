# expo-router-layout-routing
Showcase of expo-router bug causing folder-based routes with _layout to not be routable.

Only change from project generated by `npx create-expo-app@latest --template tabs@49` is setting modal.tsx to a modal folder with index.tsx and _layout.tsx.  This change causes `<Link href="/modal" />` to do nothing.

Observe the problem by clicking the info button in upper right on the index tab.
